            <p> <span> Project:</span> School Website Development <br> <br>
                I worked on a project focused on building a website for a school to improve communication
                and access to information for students, teachers, and parents. During development, I faced several
                challenges such as organizing large amounts of content, ensuring responsive design across different
                devices, and optimizing performance. I strengthened my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and basic backend
                integration while applying problem-solving techniques to overcome these issues. By structuring the content
                clearly, implementing responsive layouts, and improving navigation, I delivered a functional,
                user-friendly, and scalable website that meets the school's needs.

                solutions and attract potential clients. The project involved presenting technical services clearly while
                keeping the platform simple and accessible for non-technical users. I faced challenges such as explaining
                complex energy concepts, building trust with users, and optimizing the website for performance and mobile
                devices. Through this project, I developed skills in web design, frontend and backend development, 
                and problem-solving. I addressed these challenges by simplifying content, creating clear service sections,
                and implementing a responsive, user-friendly interface that supports the startup's business goals.

                 <span>Project:</span>  Wood Construction Company Website <br> <br>
                 I worked on a project for a wood construction company to showcase its services and completed projects
                  while strengthening its online presence. One of the main challenges was presenting technical 
                  construction details in a clear and attractive way, as well as organizing project portfolios effectively.
                   I also faced issues related to responsive design and performance optimization. Through this project,
                    I improved my skills in frontend and backend development, UI/UX design, and content structuring.
                     I solved these problems by creating a clean layout, clear service sections, and a responsive, 
                     user-friendly website that highlights craftsmanship, sustainability, and the company's expertise.
